AI-Based Neonatal Jaundice Risk Model Implementation Guide (Multi-Omics)
Abstract
Neonatal jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) is a common condition affecting newborns, and timely identification of high-risk cases is crucial to prevent severe complications like kernicterus. Traditional prediction methods rely on general risk factors and bilirubin levels, but they lack personalization and may miss subtle individual differences. This dissertation presents a novel AI-Based Multi-Omics Model for the early detection of neonatal jaundice, leveraging genomic, metabolomic, and breast milk composition data in addition to standard clinical factors. The proposed model generates a personalized risk score for each newborn, reflecting their unique biological profile and predisposition to severe jaundice.
A comprehensive methodology is developed, including the collection of multi-omics data (genetic variants, metabolic profiles, and maternal milk constituents) and integration of these features using advanced machine learning techniques. The model’s performance is compared against conventional regression-based risk assessment tools. Hypothetical results demonstrate that the multi-omics AI model can significantly outperform traditional methods, improving the early prediction of infants who will develop high bilirubin levels requiring intervention. The personalized model not only achieves higher accuracy (with greater sensitivity and specificity) but also provides insights into the biological factors driving jaundice risk.
In discussion, the dissertation examines the innovation of integrating diverse omics data for individualized neonatal care. It explores the practical implementation of the model in hospital settings—such as inclusion in newborn screening protocols—and how it could enable proactive interventions that reduce reliance on phototherapy and prevent hospital readmissions. The work concludes that an AI-driven multi-omics approach holds great promise in transforming neonatal jaundice management, exemplifying a step toward precision medicine in neonatal care.
